In Javascript, OOP, is based in prototypes.

Literal objects in Javascript are not the same thing as objects created via classes (Instances of that class).

Instead, Literal Objects are instances of the original Object prototype (Call it, the original Object, the GOD object)

Instances of a class that create objects, are instances of that class BUT, by creating classes, those classes are also Literal Objects, that themselvs are instances of the original Object prototype.

So by creating an object via a class, you will inherit that class prototype ASWELL as the original Object prototype.
